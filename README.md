# App-Requests-
**Description:** Send email to requestor after Google form submission, then formats that data into a Google Slide deck.

**Inspiration** Staff would request and app for student use, and wait a month for the app committee to meet and discuss the app. So the staff member who made the request wouldn't know the app review process, or recieve any confirmation of submission before. So I created this form/email sender.
